### Project Setup
I began by creating a new React project with vite
I created a clean, modular folder structure to contain my components, Types,  data and assets. 
Next, I updated the README.md docs to contain all valuable information such as how to start and run the project.
Finally, I committed my changes to GitHub and hosted the project on Netlify
